## üí¨ Recommendations

### **For MVP Launch (Sprints 1-2 only):**
Focus on critical fixes + personalization. Skip analytics initially.
- **Timeline:** 2 weeks
- **Goal:** Workouts that actually work for users
- **Success:** Users can complete full flow, get usable workouts

### **For Full Launch (Sprints 1-3):**
Complete experience with analytics and tracking.
- **Timeline:** 3 weeks
- **Goal:** Complete, polished BTN product
- **Success:** Users return weekly, track progress

### **My Recommendation:**
**Do Sprint 1 immediately** (this week), then evaluate:
- If user testing goes well ‚Üí proceed to Sprint 2
- If issues arise ‚Üí pause and iterate

BTN is already 70% done - don't let perfect be enemy of good!
