## üî¥ PHASE 1: Save Workout History to Database

### 1.1 Database Schema
- [ ] Create `btn_workouts` table (or use existing `program_workouts` table?)
  - `id` (primary key)
  - `user_id` (foreign key to users)
  - `workout_name` (string)
  - `workout_format` (string: "For Time", "AMRAP", "EMOM", etc.)
  - `time_domain` (string: "Sprint", "Short", "Medium", "Long", "Extended")
  - `exercises` (JSONB: array of {name, reps, weight})
  - `rounds` (int, nullable)
  - `amrap_time` (int, nullable)
  - `pattern` (string, nullable: "21-15-9", "1-2-3-4-5", etc.)
  - `generated_at` (timestamp)
  - `completed` (boolean, default false)
  - `completed_at` (timestamp, nullable)
  - `result` (string, nullable: time or rounds+reps)
  - `notes` (text, nullable)
  - `created_at` (timestamp)

### 1.2 API Routes
- [ ] `POST /api/btn/generate-workout` 
  - Accept parameters (time domain, format preferences)
  - Call generation logic
  - Save to database
  - Return generated workout

- [ ] `GET /api/btn/workouts`
  - Fetch user's workout history
  - Support filtering by date, time domain, completed status
  - Return list of workouts

- [ ] `PATCH /api/btn/workouts/:id`
  - Update workout (mark completed, add result, add notes)

- [ ] `DELETE /api/btn/workouts/:id`
  - Delete a workout (if user doesn't like it)

### 1.3 Update Generator Component
- [ ] Update `BTNWorkoutGenerator` to call API instead of local function
- [ ] Save generated workouts to database
- [ ] Add "Save Workout" or auto-save after generation
- [ ] Show workout history below generator
- [ ] Add "Log Result" button for each workout
- [ ] Add workout detail modal with result logging

  - Equipment (from `user_equipment` table)
  - Skills (from `user_skills` table)
  - 1RMs (from `user_one_rms` table)
  - Gender, body weight (from `users` table)

### 2.2 Equipment Filtering

- [ ] Examples:
  - No Ring Muscle-ups ‚Üí exclude or substitute
  - Beginner Double Unders ‚Üí max 30-50 reps
  - Advanced Pull-ups ‚Üí can do 20+ reps

### 2.4 Weight Personalization
- [ ] Use user's 1RMs to calculate workout weights
  - Clean 1RM = 225 ‚Üí workout weight = 135 (60%)
  - Snatch 1RM = 185 ‚Üí workout weight = 95 (51%)
- [ ] If no 1RM entered ‚Üí use current generic weights
- [ ] Adjust by gender (already have male/female in utils.ts)

### 2.5 "Roll Your Own" Mode
- [ ] Add toggle switch at top of generator:
  ```
  [ ] Roll Your Own Mode
  "Generate workouts without equipment/skill restrictions"
  ```
- [ ] When enabled:

## ‚ùì OPEN QUESTIONS

1. **Database Table:**
   - Create new `btn_workouts` table?
   - Or reuse existing `program_workouts` table with a `workout_type` field?

2. **Workout Limits:**
   - Should BTN users have unlimited workout generation?
   - Or limit to X workouts per day/week?

3. **Result Logging:**
   - Simple text field for time/rounds?
   - Or structured fields (minutes, seconds, rounds, reps)?

4. **BTN + Premium:**
   - If user upgrades, do they keep BTN access?
   - Or does Premium include BTN?

5. **Analytics Complexity:**
   - How detailed should BTN analytics be vs. Premium?
   - Same heat map or simplified version?
